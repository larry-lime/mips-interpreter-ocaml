(* Take a look at the definition of the Mips AST and machine state in mips_ast.ml *)

(* Given a starting state, simulate the Mips machine code to get a final state;
   a final state is reached if the the next instruction pointed to by the PC is
   all 0s.

(*
  Here are a few details/assumptions about the assembler and interpreter that the autograder makes:
  * > Big Endian Encoding
  * > Program Data is stored starting at 0x400000
  * > Stack grows downward starting at 0x7ffffffc
  * > GP points to 30000000
  * > The assembler uses register 1 as temp storage for encoding Li
  * > We don't implement delay slots in either assembly or bitcode semantics
  * > As stated in lecture, we shift jump and break immediates left by 2
  * > The PC is always incremented before executing an instruction
  * > Beq subtracts 4 from the PC before adding its offset
  * > We preserve the top 4 bits of the PC when executing a jal
